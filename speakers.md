# RHIME Speaker Series

The RHIME program hosts invited speakers so participants can see how mathematics in their projects affects the real world. These speakers will include academics who can speak to the social context of the project, community leaders who work directly with the affected populations, and members of industry who can speak to the importance and employability of the skills participants will develop.
