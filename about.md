The RHIME program is designed to provide mathematical enrichment and mentoring for undergraduate mathematics students at St. Thomas Aquinas College (STAC). RHIME consists of a semester-long program where math faculty (assisted by upperclassmen who are math or computer science majors) lead a small group of students in research projects which apply statistical methods and technology to analyze socially relevant, accessible, and real-world problems.

# Objectives

RHIME has three main goals:

1. Increasing enrollment at STAC of mathematics majors and minors in underrepresented groups,
2. Increasing experiential learning opportunities in the use of mathematics and technology for students in these groups, and
3. Increasing awareness of the broad applicability and importance of mathematical knowledge in the world at large.

We aim to meet these goals by providing

1. mathematically rich projects in social context,
2. engagement with leaders in academia, the community, and the workforce, and
3. mentoring from both advanced undergraduates and faculty.
