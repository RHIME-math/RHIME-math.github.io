My name is Olivia Gaillard and I am a Junior at St. Thomas Aquinas College with a major in Chemistry and minor in mathematics. During my time at STAC, I am an active member of the college soccer team and on the executive board of the Multicultural Student Organization. Outside of academics, I find joy in exploring different foods and cherishing moments with loved ones. Committed to learning and making a positive impact, I am eager to translate my knowledge and dedication into a fulfilling career in dentistry.
