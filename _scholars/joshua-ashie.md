I am a dedicated student-athlete from Toronto, Canada, looking to develop my applicability of mathematics while increasing my interpersonal skills. I am an Exercise Science major in the 2027 graduating class of St. Thomas Aquinas College and I am keen to grasp this great opportunity I have before me with full force.
