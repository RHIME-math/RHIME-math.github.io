My name is Karla Zamora and I'm currently a senior at St. Thomas Aquinas College, majoring in Criminal Justice along with a double minor in Human Rights and Social Justice and History.
I'm looking forward to graduating this upcoming Spring and officially beginning Law School in the Fall of '24.
Due to my experiences in the U.S. Immigration System, I want to become an Immigration Attorney with a specialization in deportations and work on family-based naturalization.
<!--Also, I want to become an advocate for both DACA and TPS beneficiaries.-->
<!--In these past three years as an undergrad, I have completed internships with State Senator Elijah Reinchlin-Melncik, the Legal Services of the Hudson Valley in their Immigration Unit, the Human Rights Commission, worked in immigration law firms, and I'm currently working part-time on campus as the Orientation Coordinator.-->
As a Latina and first-generation college student, I am looking forward to completing my undergraduate degree and pursuing higher education.
