My name is Holger Sanchez and I am a freshman at St. Thomas Aquinas College. I am majoring in Management and minoring in Hospitality Management. I am very close with my family. My cousin also goes to STAC and she has always told me that STAC will become a second home to me and it did. All the information I learn from the RHIME program I plan to incorporate in my professional career when managing a business and a team. My dream is to have a business of my own. I don't know what but I know it will have to do with hospitality.
