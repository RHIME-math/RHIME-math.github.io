My name is Bruktawit Abebe and I am a junior at STAC majoring in computer science with a minor in Biology. During my time at the college so far, I have participated in various programs such as the STEM Exploration Program and have recently worked as a Website Redesign intern for the launching of the collegeâ€™s new website under the Marketing and Communications department. I am also a member of the International Students Organization. My career goal is to thrive in the technological world as a cyber security analyst or combine my knowledge of Biology and computer science and work in a field that utilizes both. I enjoy reading mystery books and writing short stories and poems.
