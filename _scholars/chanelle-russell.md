My name is Chanelle Russell, and I'm a freshman at STAC majoring in Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I'm a dedicated member of the NCAA Women's Triathlon Team and a member of the International Students Organization. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decision-making in business management. In the future, I aspire to apply my expertise to assist companies in optimizing their operations and strategies through advanced data analysis techniques. Outside of my academic and athletic pursuits, I enjoy listening to music and creating short blogs/posts on my Instagram story, fostering connections and creativity beyond the classroom and triathlon.
