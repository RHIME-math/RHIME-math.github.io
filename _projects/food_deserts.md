Abstract: This project delves into the critical issue of food desserts in two distinct regions of New York: Brooklyn, an urban environment, and Rockland County, a mix of suburban and rural areas. A food desert is an area in which it is difficult to buy affordable or good quality fresh food. Our analysis aims to investigate the interplay between median Family Income, and low access to supermarkets within a 1-mile radius (urban) and 10-mile radius (rural).
