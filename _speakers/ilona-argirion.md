Dr. Ilona Argirion earned her M.P.H. in Epidemiology and Ph.D. in Environmental Health Sciences (Occupation and Environmental Epidemiology) from the University of Michigan. Upon completing her Ph.D., Dr. Argirion conducted her postdoctoral training at the National Cancer Institute’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, where she largely focused her research on the immunoepidemiology of cancers with infectious etiology. Her multifaceted research portfolio includes: descriptive and molecular epidemiology studies of global head and neck cancer, evaluation of biological differences in hepatic disease progression among those chronically infected with hepatitis B and C, humoral immune response variability across patients with Epstein–Barr virus related cancers, and studies focused on better understanding the underlying etiology and biology of biliary tract cancers.
