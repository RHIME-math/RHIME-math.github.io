#### Rockland-Hudson Immersive Mathematics Experience
# Data science projects with social context.

The RHIME program is a mathematics enrichment program at St. Thomas Aquinas College, designed to provide mentoring and experiential learning opportunities for students from under-represented groups.

<!--RHIME consists of a semester semester-long program where math faculty (assisted by upperclassmen who are math or computer science majors) lead a small group of students in research projects which apply statistical methods and technology to analyze socially relevant, accessible, and real-world problems.

RHIME has three main goals:

1. Increasing enrollment at STAC of mathematics majors and minors in underrepresented groups,
2. Increasing experiential learning opportunities in the use of mathematics and technology for students in these groups, and
3. Increasing awareness of the broad applicability and importance of mathematical knowledge in the world at large.

We aim to meet these goals by providing

1. mathematically rich projects in social context,
2. engagement with leaders in academia, the community, and the workforce, and
3. mentoring from both advanced undergraduates and faculty.
