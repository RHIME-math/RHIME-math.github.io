<!--The RHIME program is designed to provide mathematical enrichment and mentoring for undergraduate mathematics students at St. Thomas Aquinas College (STAC). RHIME consists of a semester-long program where math faculty (assisted by upperclassmen who are math or computer science majors) lead a small group of students in research projects which apply statistical methods and technology to analyze socially relevant, accessible, and real-world problems.-->

<!--# Objectives

RHIME has three main goals:

1. Increasing enrollment at STAC of mathematics majors and minors in underrepresented groups,
2. Increasing experiential learning opportunities in the use of mathematics and technology for students in these groups, and
3. Increasing awareness of the broad applicability and importance of mathematical knowledge in the world at large.

We aim to meet these goals by providing

1. mathematically rich projects in social context,
2. engagement with leaders in academia, the community, and the workforce, and
3. mentoring from both advanced undergraduates and faculty.

Please get in touch if you'd like to be involved!-->

<!--The Rockland-Hudson Immersive Mathematics Experience (RHIME) engaged undergraduate students with collaborative projects that relate mathematics and data science to social questions relevant in their lives. Participants will work in groups, guided by an undergraduate peer mentor as well as the faculty advisor.-->
<br />
Each participant will receive a $500 stipend upon completion of the program.

The RHIME program aims to
 1) increase enrollment at STAC of mathematics majors and minors in underrepresented groups,
 2) increase experiential learning opportunities in the use of mathematics and technology for students in these groups, and
 3) increase awareness of the broad applicability and importance of mathematical knowledge in the world at large.

For these reasons, underrepresented backgrounds are especially encouraged to apply!

Requirements: Participants are required to have an hour-long weekly meeting with the group to discuss progress towards the goal of the project. Approximately four hours of independent work by the student is expected between meetings. By the end of the semester, each group will produce a summary report of their analysis and findings, with the goal of informing their peers about their findings as well as the social context of their project.

Qualifications: Any freshman, sophomore, or junior is eligible to apply if they have completed a mathematics course at STAC with a grade of B or higher, or if they have sufficient mathematics background from high school coursework. Others with unusual background will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
